#  Industrial Automation System Design Using Open-Source IIoT SCADA with AI-Enhanced Predictive Analytics

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of an **open-source IIoT-based SCADA system** that integrates **edge computing**, **MQTT communication**, and **AI-driven predictive analytics** for intelligent energy management.  
The framework provides a **cost-effective, modular, and scalable** approach to modernising industrial control systems, enabling real-time monitoring, environmental data integration, and adaptive energy optimisation.

##  Key Features

- **Open-Source IIoT Architecture:** Built with Arduino Uno R4 Wi-Fi, Node-RED, InfluxDB, and MQTT.  
- **Edge Computing Integration:** Raspberry Pi handles local decision-making and real-time control.  
- **Predictive Analytics Engine:** Random Forest regression model forecasts energy consumption based on process and environmental temperatures.  
- **Interactive Web Interface:** Streamlit app for real-time energy prediction and user interaction.  
- **Secure Data Flow:** MQTT with authentication, Wi-Fi isolation, and static IP configuration.  
- **Scalable Design:** Easily adaptable for SMEs and multi-variable industrial processes.

##  System Architecture

The system follows a modular, three-layer architecture:

- **Sensing Layer:** Arduino Uno R4 Wi-Fi collects real-time process data (temperature, current) via DS18B20 and ACS712 sensors.  
- **Network Layer:** Data is streamed over MQTT to a Raspberry Pi edge node running Node-RED.  
- **Application Layer:** Node-RED handles flow logic, visualization, and anomaly detection; data is logged to InfluxDB and used for AI model training in Python.

##  Core Capabilities

- Real-time process/environment telemetry ingestion  
- Edge-based orchestration and local control  
- InfluxDB time-series data retention and visualization  
- Predictive analytics using Scikit-learn  
- Web-based interface via Streamlit for live inference  
- Lightweight and replicable for SMEs and research labs

##  How It Works

1. **Data Collection:** Sensors send temperature and current data via MQTT to Raspberry Pi.  
2. **Processing:** Node-RED parses and logs data into InfluxDB.  
3. **AI Prediction:** Python model predicts energy use using Random Forest regression.  
4. **Visualization:** Streamlit app displays real-time energy prediction and process trends.

##  Model Development

The predictive model was developed using the **Scikit-learn** library in Python. Process and environmental temperature data were used as features to predict energy consumption.

### **Training Procedure**
1. The dataset was split into training and testing sets (80:20 ratio).  
2. A **Random Forest Regression** model was instantiated and trained on the training data.  
3. Model performance was validated using test data.

### **Training Code Example**


from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
import joblib

#### Define features and target
X = df[['process_temperature', 'environmental_temperature']]
y = df['instantaneous_energy_consumption']

#### Train/test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

#### Train model
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

#### Save model
joblib.dump(model, 'energy_predictor_model.pkl')


## GUI Development Using Streamlit**

The Streamlit app enables users to input temperature values and obtain instant energy predictions through a lightweight web interface.

### Streamlit GUI Code

import streamlit as st
import joblib
import numpy as np

#### Load model
model = joblib.load('energy_predictor_model.pkl')

st.title('Energy Consumption Predictor')

pt = st.number_input('Enter Process Temperature')
et = st.number_input('Enter Environmental Temperature')

if st.button('Predict Energy Consumption'):
    prediction = model.predict(np.array([[pt, et]]))
    st.success(f'Predicted Energy Consumption: {prediction[0]:.2f}')
