# An open-source, modular IIoT-based SCADA system featuring InfluxDB-powered telemetry, edge processing, and AI-driven energy forecasting.

This project implements a scalable, real-time, IIoT-enabled SCADA system designed for intelligent process monitoring and predictive energy management. Leveraging open-source platforms such as Arduino Uno R4 WiFi, Node-RED, InfluxDB, and MATLAB/Python, this system exemplifies the integration of edge computing, cloud-based data storage, and AI-driven predictive analytics.

## üîç Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a real-time industrial monitoring system leveraging:

- **InfluxDB** for high-resolution time-series telemetry logging  
- **MQTT + Node-RED** for data orchestration and dashboarding  
- **Arduino Uno R4 Wi-Fi** for sensor data acquisition  
- **Raspberry Pi** as the edge compute platform  
- **Scikit-learn + Streamlit** for AI-based energy prediction  

Designed for **low-cost**, **scalable**, and **energy-aware** automation in industrial environments.

## üîß System Architecture

The solution follows a modular, three-layer architecture 
![Node-RED Flow and Dashboard](System.jpg)
- **Sensing Layer:** Arduino Uno R4 WiFi collects real-time process data (temperature, current) via DS18B20 and ACS712 sensors.
- **Network Layer:** Data is streamed over MQTT to a Raspberry Pi edge node running Node-RED.
- **Application Layer:** Node-RED handles flow logic, visualization, and anomaly detection; data is logged to InfluxDB and used for AI model training in MATLAB/ Python.
